# A *Faster* Pytorch Implementation of Faster R-CNN

## Introduction


* **It is pure Pytorch code**. We convert all the numpy implementations to pytorch!


### What we are doing and going to do

- [ ] Add deformable pooling layer (mainly supported by [Xander](https://github.com/xanderchf)).
- [x] Support pytorch-0.4.0.
- [ ] Support tensorboardX.
- [ ] Support pytorch-0.4.1 or higher.
