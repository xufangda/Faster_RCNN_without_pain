        This function samples total of :obj:`self.n_sample` RoIs

        The RoIs are assigned with the ground truth class labels as well as
        bounding box offsets and scales to match the ground truth bounding
        boxes. As many as :obj:`pos_ratio * self.n_sample` RoIs are
        sampled as foregrounds.

        Offsets and scales of bounding boxes are calculated using
        :func:`model.utils.bbox_tools.bbox2loc`.
        Also, types of input arrays and output arrays are same.

        Here are notations.

        * :math:`S` is the total number of sampled RoIs, which equals \
            :obj:`self.n_sample`.
        * :math:`L` is number of object classes possibly including the \

                is :math:`(R',)`. Its range is :math:`[0, L - 1]`, where
                :math:`L` is the number of foreground classes.
